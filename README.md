# BikeSharing
Citibike analysis by using Tableau visualization

## Overview of the Project.

There is still some more work to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.
For this analysis, We used Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype to get the time in hours, minutes, and seconds (00:00:00). After we converted the "tripduration" column to a datetime dataytpe, we exported the DataFrame as a CSV file to use for the trip analysis and created the visualization by using Tableau.


## Results:
We created a set of visualizations shuch as:  

- **Below the both graphs shows the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders**

This visualization indicates the length of time of every bike ride during the month of August  It shows the peek time is between 2 and 15 minutes.
